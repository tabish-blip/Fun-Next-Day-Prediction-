Next Day Predictor

A tiny, humorous web app that proudly predicts the wrong next day.
Just pick a day of the week and let the “AI” run through an overly dramatic process before giving you a confidently incorrect answer.

Features

Simple, single-file HTML app

Fake processing animation

Intentionally wrong predictions

Light, fun, and perfect for sharing


How It Works

1. User selects a day


2. App performs several “AI processes”


3. Correct next day is ignored


4. A random wrong day is shown as the final prediction
